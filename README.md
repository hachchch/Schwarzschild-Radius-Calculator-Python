# The Schwarzschild radius

The Schwarzschild radius is the size of a mass body when the speed at which it can shake off the gravitational force of that mass is greater than or equal to the speed of light. In layman's terms, the Schwarzschild radius is used to find the size(radius) of a mass body to become a black hole

# How to use

The number you can enter is mass (kg). Press = to calculate the Schwarzschild radius from the mass.
